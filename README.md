# command_line_hangman_game

This game aims to allow the user to play the game "hangman" (a word guessing game). The game is meant to take user input (a letter) and determine if that letter is contained in the hidden word. If so, it will return a string of characters (to represent any letters not guessed) as well as the correctly guessed letter. If the letter is incorrect, the player will lose one "life." The function for guessing will run until either the user guesses all of the letters in the word, resulting in a new game, or until the player no longer have "lives" left. 

Please note that this is not the final version as there are still bugs to be worked out in relation to the guesses remaining and providing another random word if all letters have been guessed in the current game.
